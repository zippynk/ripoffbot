#  To run ripoffbot, type `python ripoffbot.py <host> <channel (no #)> [--ssl|--plain] <nick> [--classic] [--readconfig] [--nodb]` into a terminal, replacing the placeholders with your configuration.

# The `--classic` flag enables a mode intended to mirror the original mailbot as much as possible.
# The `--readconfig` flag reads all other data (with the exception of the `--classic` and `--nodb` flags) from the file titled `config.json` in the same directory as ripoffbot. This installation should contain an example configuration file, titled `config_example.json`.
# The `--password` flag prompts the user for a password when starting ripoffbot. Note that you may not be able to see the password as you type it, and that this can interfere with running ripoffbot in a location where you cannot actively input text. Does not run with `--readconfig`, as it does not apply there; the `config.json` file has an option for a password.
# The `--nodb` flag disables saving messages between sessions.

#  Based on Hardmath123's jokebot. https://github.com/hardmath123/jokebot
#  Modified to be a mailbot ripoff by Nathan Krantz-Fire (a.k.a zippynk). https://github.com/zippynk/ripoffbot
#  Ripped off from Aaron Weiss's mailbot (meaning that although no code was directly re-used, it behaves as similar to Aaron's mailbot as possible on the outside). https://github.com/aatxe/mailbot
