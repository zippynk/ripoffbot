Ripoffbot is an IRC mailbot. It is based off and is of jokebot by Hardmath123, and was modified into  a ripoff of Aaron Weiss's mailbot by Nathan Krantz-Fire (a.k.a zippynk). However, since then, it has gained several new features that said mailbot does not include.

To run ripoffbot, type `python ripoffbot.py <host> <channel (no #)> [--ssl|--plain] <nick> [--classic] [--readconfig] [--password] [--nodb]` into a terminal, replacing the placeholders with your configuration.

The `--classic` flag enables a mode intended to mirror the original mailbot as much as possible.

The `--readconfig` flag reads all other data (with the exception of the `--classic` and `--nodb` flags) from the file titled `config.json` in the same directory as ripoffbot. This installation should contain an example configuration file, titled `config_example.json`.

The `--password` flag prompts the user for a password when starting ripoffbot. Note that you may not be able to see the password as you type it, and that this can interfere with running ripoffbot in a location where you cannot actively input text. Does not run with `--readconfig`, as it does not apply there; the `config.json` file has an option for a password.

The `--nodb` flag disables saving messages between sessions.

# Commands (run from IRC):

`@tell recipient message` delivers `message` to `recipient` when they are next "seen" saying something. If they are "seen" next in a private message to ripoffbot, `message` will be delivered in a reply to that message, and ripoffbot will send a notification message to the sender in the from that the sender sent the original `@tell` command (either in the public channel or via a private message).

`@privtell recipient message` delivers `message` to `recipient` via a private message when they are next "seen" saying something. Wherever they are seen, `message` will still be sent to them privately. Upon delivery, ripoffbot will privately send a notification message to the sender. Not available in classic mode.

`@mailhelp` displays a message similar to this guide, but tailored to IRC users. Not available in classic mode.

# Database

Ripoffbot stores messages in a file titled `.ripoffbot_database.p` in the home directory of the account that runs it.
